# Description
Facebook Home Page is a static website that I created to strengthen my HTML and CSS skills. 

## How its Made
This project involved the use of HTML and CSS. I made great use of floats when positioning elements on this page. During this project I also got to take advantage of fontawesome's free icons. Manipulating margin and padding played a large role in producing the finished product. 


## What I Learned
During this project I had the opportunity to explore fontawesome for the first time. Learning how to effectively manipulate the icons served me well in later projects. The most challengin part of this project was positioning and styling the input bars on the right hand side of thepage. However, with persistence and strategic sectioning I was able to set them in the right place by manipulating their widths, heights, and margins. Because of themany similar elements on the page, I also got to exercise proper specificity usage when targeting multiple nav bars and distinguihing them from others.
